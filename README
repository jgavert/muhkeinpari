Releasing my own solution as the competition is already over and I didn't get anything.
Also I haven't gotten any kind of mail about my answer so releasing it on my own accord.
So I'm assuming that this is super bad answer with code quality that is worse than anything.
I'll let you be the critic and let the code speak for itself. How it should be.

Problem was to find the word pair that has the most unique characters, or pairs if there are more than one.

Compiling:
  Requires something like clang 3.4 or better, g++ 4.8 or better or visual studio 2015 rc

  Usage:
  ./muhkeatparit <filepath>

  Also the corei7-avx is optional, but provides the best performance. Just used for counting some one bits.

Some benchmark data:
  asus eeepc 901        0.670s (clang without avx, very fast compared to the faster cpu's. Clear indication that I'm doing something wrong.)
  i7-4770k 3,6ghz + ssd 0.075s (the most consistent result, visualstudio 2015 with avx)
  i5-2520m + ssd        0.330s (clang + avx)
